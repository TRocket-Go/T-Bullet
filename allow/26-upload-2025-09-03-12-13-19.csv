上週五 #瀾湄合作外長會議 中國外長王毅再次散播錯誤訊息，扭曲二戰事實等謬論。外交部長林佳龍嚴正駁斥並強調：

二戰結束後，具有國際法效力的《舊金山和約》取代《開羅宣言》及《波茲坦公告》等政治聲明，該和約並未將台灣交給中華人民共和國，中華人民共和國從未統治過台灣！

台灣自1980年代中期開始，由下而上推動政治自由化與民主化，並在1996年完成首次總統直選，至此中華民國政府的中央行政、立法代表皆由台灣人民選出，從此成為有效統治，並對外代表台灣的唯一合法政府，也確立中華民國台灣與中華人民共和國對等存在、互不隸屬的現狀！

中華民國台灣與中華人民共和國互不隸屬是客觀事實，中華人民共和國更無權在國際社會上代表台灣。呼籲北京當局務實理性體認只有透過與代表台灣人民的民選政府進行尊重與平等的對話，才能改善兩岸關係！

外交部強調，只有台灣民選政府，才能在國際場域代表台灣人民！

MOFA utterly refutes PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi's distortion of WWII history!

Last Friday at the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi spread falsehoods in regard to the historical record, which MOFA Minister Lin Chia-lung refutes as follows:

The signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which was binding under international law, supplanted the political statements contained in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The treaty did not cede control of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, which has never governed Taiwan.

Since the mid-1980s, Taiwan has experienced political liberalization and democratization, leading to the completion of its first direct presidential election in 1996. At that point, the central executive and legislative representatives of government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) were all elected by the people of Taiwan—and since then, the Republic of China (Taiwan) government has been the sole legitimate government exercising effective rule over Taiwan and representing Taiwan internationally. This also confirmed the status quo wherein the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China exist as equals, neither subordinate to the other.

This objective reality means that the PRC has no mandate to represent Taiwan on the global stage. If they desire to improve cross-strait ties, we call on Beijing to be rational and pragmatic, addressing the Taiwanese people through their democratically elected government with respect and as equals.

MOFA reiterates that only the democratically elected government of Taiwan has the right to represent the interests of the Taiwanese people in the international community!
